# batch-performance-prediction

Data is being recorded from various condition monitoring sensors in a manufacturing plant. There are hundreds of such sensors which may be impacting the quality of final product which is getting manufactured, hence we can model this problem as a multivariate regression problem. Important point to note about real-life datasets is that they have various shifts since they are being recorded over the period of time and environment changes with time and further that is going to be the main focus of this project.
